# tapAudio
tapAudio uses OSU beatmaps to play haptics of music.

# What happened to this project?
I immediately abandoned it as soon as Guilherme Rambo told me that Core Haptics will be released with iOS 13.

This doesn't support all music and haptics vary too much so it is kind of horrible. 

Even though performance wise it was better than TapticMusic, its battery life, CPU usage, and RAM management were quite bad.

Initial indexing takes more than an hour to finish if you have over 500 songs as it has to go through 
Bloodcat's server to search for beatmaps.

Good thing I did not spend more time on this!
